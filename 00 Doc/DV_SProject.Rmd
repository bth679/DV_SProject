#For this project, we are going to use the Baltimore Salaries and Texas Salaries datasets to produce the scatter plot, crosstab with KPI and parameters, and also a bar chart with reference lines on a Shiny Application
  
#First, we need to source the following packages
```{r}
require("ggplot2")
require("ggtheme")
require("gplots")
require("grid")
require("RCurl")
require("reshape2")
require("tableplot")
require("tidyr")
require("dplyr")
require("jsonlite")
require("extrafont")
require("lubridate")
```
  
#Next, we need to run the Texas Salaries R_ETL.R and Baltimore Salaries R_ETL.R to create the 2 tables on SQL server.
![](Texas_salaries.png)
CREATE TABLE Texas_Salaries (  
-- Change table_name to the table name you want.  
name varchar2(4000),  
jobtitle varchar2(4000),  
agencyid varchar2(4000),  
agency varchar2(4000),  
hiredate varchar2(4000),  
annualsalary varchar2(4000),  
grosspay varchar2(4000),  
annual_salary number(38,4),  
serialid number(38,4)  
);
  

#After we successfully uploaded the dataset onto Oracle, we now produce the 3 plots on the Shiny Application.
  
##First Plot is a scatterplot.
